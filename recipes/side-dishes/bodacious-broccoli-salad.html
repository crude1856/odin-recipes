    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This broccoli salad with bacon and cheese is requested at every family gathering.
      Let it be your next dish that they crave! I like this dish to be prepared at least 
      two hours before serving. Be sure to have copies of the recipe on hand, as everyone 
      will ask for it!</p> 
    
    
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

    <!--I forgot to wrap the items on a paragraph tag-->

      <li>8 slices of bacon</li>
      <li>2 heads of fresh brocolli, chopped</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups of sharp Cheddar cheese, shredded</li>
      <li>1/2 large red onion, chopped</li>
      <li>2/3 cup of mayonnaise</li>
      <li>1/4 cup of red wine vinegar</li>
      <li>1/8 cup of white sugar</li>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 1: </strong>
        <p>Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until 
          crisp and evenly browned, 8-10 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate 
          and crumble when cool enough to handle.</p> 
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Step 2: </strong>
        <p>Combine bacon, broccoli, cheese, and onion in a large bowl.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <strong>Step 3: </strong>
        <p>Whisk mayonnaise, red wine vinegar, sugar, pepper, salt, and lemon juice together
          in a small bowl; pour over salad and toss to combine. Cover and refrigerate until 
          ready to serve.</p>
