      <li>1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups white sugar</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 cup milk</li>
    </ul>

    
    <h3>Steps:</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 1: </strong>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a muffin pan with paper 
          or foil liners.</p> 
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Step 2: </strong>
        <p>Sift together flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <strong>Step 3: </strong>
        <p>Cream together sugar and butter in a large bowl until light and fluffy. 
          Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla. 
          Add flour mixture in two batches, alternating with milk; beat well. Spoon batter 
          into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 3/4 full.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Step 4: </strong>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out 
          clean, 15 to 17 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool before serving or 
          frosting.</p>
      </li>
